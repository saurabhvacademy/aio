                            remember user information, preferences and activity, to enable the Company to provide
                            services to the User when the User next returns to the Website or Services. The Company also

                            on the User’s computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may

                        provide the User, as and when requested by the User, with access to his/her personal information

                        removed before processing such requests, and the Company may decline to process requests that
                        are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
                        the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
                        information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any

                        service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of
                        the way the Company maintains certain services, after a User deletes his/her information,
                        residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from the Company’s active
                        servers and may remain in the backup systems.

                  Only you and the people you’re messaging can view your conversation.
                  Each of your conversations is separate. Even if some of the same people

                  and then Jane is included in a different conversation among a larger

                    cookies to allow its systems to uniquely identify a User/s during a session or while the User/s is
                    logged into the Website or Services. This allows the Company to process the User/s online
                    transactions and requests and verify the User/s identity, after logging in, as the User/s moves
                    through the Website or Services.</p>

                    information, preferences and activity, to enable the Company to provide services to the User/s when
                    the User/s next returns to the Website or Services.  The Company also uses persistent cookies to
                    track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other

                    browser cookie because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, the User/s cannot control,
                    delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through its web browser.
                    For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to

                    specific Flash LSO.</p>

                User/s, as and when requested by the User/s, with access to his/her personal information and shall
                further ensure that any personal information or sensitive personal data or information found to be
                inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or amended as feasible, subject to any requirement for such
                personal information or sensitive personal data or information shall be retained by law or for
                legitimate business purposes. <br>
                The Company asks individual users and entities to identify themselves and the information requested to
                be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and the Company may decline to
                process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
                effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests
                concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. <br>
                In any case, where the Company provides information access and correction, the Company performs this
                service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way
                the Company maintains certain services, after a User deletes his/her information, residual copies may
                take a period of time before they are deleted from the Company’s active servers and may remain in the
                backup systems.
